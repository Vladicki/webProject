# CV Builder
This is a web development project by Harsh, Vladick, Quentin and Ruslan. We made a website that allows users to create and to view CVs. For the backend, we used MongoDB as our database and using Express.js to connect it to Node. The server is hosted using Heroku on this URL: https://griffith-webproject-server-8398a1bf085d.herokuapp.com/
